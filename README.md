📊 Customer Churn Prediction App
This project is a Streamlit-based web application that helps predict customer churn using pre-trained machine learning models. It allows users to either upload their own customer dataset or manually input individual customer details to get a real-time churn prediction.

🔍 Features
Upload your own dataset for batch predictions.

Manually input customer information for single-record predictions.

Visual performance metrics: Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve, Classification Report.

Multiple pre-trained models included: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost.

Fully interactive UI built using Streamlit.

Built-in data preprocessing and transformation pipeline.
